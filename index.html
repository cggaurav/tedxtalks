Dr van Wyhe tells us why it is important to hear the true story behind Darwin and his work to understand their scientific and human significance. In a logical manner, we are shown where certain premises attached to the popular narrative fail when brought under a strict scientific scrutiny. The matter regarding the age of the Earth is settled, the progressive nature of the history of the Earth is highlighted and this leads to Darwin's idea of Evolution. According to Dr van Wyhe, Darwin states three reasons for his theory of evolution - the existence of fossilized mammals,patterns linked to geographical distribution and the Galapagos Islands which served as a hotbed for a unique diaspora of different species. The accumulated effect of these observations - natural selection, or as Dr van Wyhe puts it 'The Gauntlet of Death' - showcased the accuracy and simplicity of Darwin's observations. With interesting excerpts and his own observations Dr van Wyhe paints a portrait of Darwin and the theory of evolution that comes to a logical conclusion." ytID="KvpQ5Lyah50"><div class='title'>TEDxNUS - Debunking myths about evolution</div><div class="img"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/KvpQ5Lyah50/2.jpg"></div></td></tr>

          <tr id="2"><td id="22" ytID="LccdxulYVuY" title="TEDxFruitvale - Joann Lo - Organizing the Workers in the Food Chain" description="In the U.S., 20 million people work throughout the food supply chain. Who are these people? At lower end of the system are people of color, immigrants, and female workers. These low-wage workers subsidize corporate profits and cheap food. Many organizations have come together in the Food Chain Workers Alliance to transform the food system by learning from each other, building more power together, and inserting workers' rights into the increasingly influential food justice movement. 

          About Joann Lo, executive director, Food Chain Workers Alliance: 
          In 1997 Joann became an organizer on campaigns with two Service Employee International Union locals in Los Angeles, which resulted in hundreds of workers at Catholic Healthcare West and Argenbright Security becoming new union members. In early 2001 she co-launched the Garment Worker Center, where as lead organizer, she supported garment workers in Los Angeles who led a successful boycott against young women's retailer Forever 21, a campaign memorialized in the Emmy award-winning documentary Made in L.A. In November 2009 Joann joined the Food Chain Workers Alliance, a coalition of worker-based groups organizing to improve wages and working conditions for all workers along the food chain.

          This talk is part of Session Two: Movement for TEDxFruitvale, which was held on October 14, 2011 at Mills College in Oakland, CA. The conference's theme was Harvesting Change, and it focused on farmworkers, labor and other social justice movements, and fair labor practices in business. http://www.tedxfruitvale.org/"><div class='title'>TEDxFruitvale - Joann Lo - Organizing the Workers in the ...</div><div class="img"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/LccdxulYVuY/2.jpg"></div></td></tr>

CNN named him one of 10 remarkable people the world is yet to know of. He began his career in art as a newspaper cartoonist, and the cartoonist's bold line -- and dead-on eye for truth -- still powers his art. His work spans painting, sculpture, installation, film and performance, always linked by his challenging opinions on identity, conformity, gender, celebrity, ceremony.

          He shows in galleries and performance spaces around the world. He also spends much of his time teaching storytelling through art. Among his latest work is an Ipad book (POP-IT) that promotes multiple perspectives and empathy. He is a two time TED speaker. He lives and works out of New York. 

          He has collaborated with world famous artists such as Paul Simon, Erykah Badu, Yann Vasnier (perfumer). He was invited to be on a BBC panel on creativity and spoken in conferences around the world. He teaches a course at NuVu Studios, an experimental education project of the MIT Media Labs in Cambridge MA."><div class='title'>TEDxGateway - Raghava KK - Meet one of most remarkable ..</div><div class="img"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/FAbGbaLGJBw/2.jpg"></div></td></tr>
